## Why a Cloud CMS

There are a several reason to create this architecture, here some of them:

* There is 1 API solution for all websites, we have to maintain just one code environment
* Each Website is a kind of API Client making calls to the API Layer
* We can have different website using the same Web Project the only differentiation is `Request.Url.Authority` and the data return is different
* We can duplicate websites using the same template but different data
* We can create a site with just one click
* There is only 1 admin platform and only 1 customer platform so if we change any of it any customer will see the changes
* Customers can have many websites in 1 customer platform and with a drop-down they can change the website to configure
* For Developers: if they want to create a website they just have to know HTML, JavaScript, CSS and a few Razor HTML Helpers
